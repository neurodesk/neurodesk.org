## Neurodesk environment

Each Jupyter notebook in the repository is equipped with a Jupyter Hub button (the little rocket) at the top. This button will allow you to interact with the notebooks in a cloud-based environment. The environment is pre-configured to support Neurodesk, so you can start experimenting with the notebooks right away without having to install any additional software or packages.

If you want to run these notebooks in another neurodesk environment, make sure to clone this repository first:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/neurodesk/example-notebooks.git
```

**ðŸ’¡ Note:** If you aren't finding what you're looking for, please <a href="https://neurodesk.org/contact/">contact us</a>.
