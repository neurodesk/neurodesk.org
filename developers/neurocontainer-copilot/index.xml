Incorporating new neuroimaging tools into Neurodesk is challenging due setting the correct environment variables, finding specific versions of the software dependencies, version requirements or specific build steps. However, writing accurate and efficient container recipes requires expertise in containerization technologies and knowledge of software dependencies. Neurocontainer Copilot can help identify these details from provided documentation (README or installation documentation) and code samples. The development involves the following steps: 1) We use existing neurocontainer recipes to generate the recipes for new tools using LLM agents. 2) We use Google Jules agent to automate the process of generating Neurocontainer recipes. 3) We use the generated recipes to create pull requests in the Neurocontainers repository, which can be reviewed and merged by the Neurocontainers team or user can use it to test the recipe locally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Neurocontainer Copilot using OpenAI Codex agent</title><link>https://neurodesk.org/developers/neurocontainer-copilot/openai-codex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neurodesk.org/developers/neurocontainer-copilot/openai-codex/</guid><description>&lt;p>While Neurodesk significantly reduces the friction associated with portability and reproducibility, incorporating new neuroimaging tools remains challenging.
